Abstract. Digital pathology has ushered in a new era of multimodal biomedical data acquisi
tion, combining high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs) and detailed pathology reports. This
 paper presents a deep learning framework that fuses these two modalities to form a unified
 representation, thereby enhancing classification, retrieval, and interpretability in computational
 pathology. In this report, we summarize the paper’s motivation, methodology, experimental
 evaluation, and contributions while providing a critical discussion relative to the state of the
 art. We also propose potential improvements to address identified weaknesses

 **Here, I have implemented this research paper partially.**
